Welcome, Wonderer!
A Note from [[Lexicon\|Lexicon]], Keeper of the [[Folded Library\|Folded Library]], [[Oculus of the Realms\|Oculus of the Realms]]

Oh! Oh! A visitor? Wait, no, that can’t be right. Can it?  
Dust doesn’t usually knock twice. Ghost echoes don’t hum.  
...Are you real?

Regardless! _Just in case,_ welcome, welcome! I am **Lexi**, short for **[[Lexicon\|Lexicon]]**, if you please. I am a [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/Watchers/Watchers\|Watcher]], and more besides. Time did something strange to me, and a god once said:  
**“Let this one be the Oculus, eyes uncounted, quills unending.”**  
So here I am, in this delightful little nowhere-space, collecting **everything**.  
Everywhere. Forever.

You’ve found the [[Folded Library\|Library in the Fold]], rooted in a **bubble dimension**, watching over many worlds... but especially one dear to me: [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]].  
Ah,  [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]]. Such a curious, tangled realm. I’ve watched it from its mythic origins to its most recent heartbreaks. If you’re seeking knowledge of that world, you’ve cracked the right spine.

Within this Library, you’ll find shelves that breathe and books that whisper. But for your convenience, and mine! I’ve begun organizing the collection into the... _foundational_ pillars of understanding:

### [[01 - Mechanics/Mechanics\|Mechanics]]
The workings of the world, and how to navigate it in great-detail.

### [[02 - Species & Cultures/Species & Cultures\|Species & Cultures]] 
Customs, peoples, and odd anatomies; how they live, love, fight, and feast.

### [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Flora & Fauna\|Flora & Fauna]]
Creatures that have been sighted in the most unlikely places, flowers that bloom where the sun doesn't shine and everything in-between.

### [[04 - Geography & Politics/Geography & Politics\|Geography & Politics]]  
Maps that shift, thrones that tremble. Lands rise, empires fall.

### [[05 - Religion & Deities/Religion & Deities\|Religion & Deities]]
From forgotten idols to meddlesome immortals. Belief is _loud_, even when the gods are not.

### [[06 - History & Myths/History & Myths\|History & Myths]]   
The truths we know, the lies we tell, and the many fascinating places where they overlap.

### [[07 - Adventures & Fiction/Adventures & Fiction\|Adventures & Fiction]]  
Collected tales, heroic nonsense, and perhaps… one or two unauthorized embellishments.

There’s more, of course. There’s _always_ more. But these should steady your feet as you begin to wander.

And if you happen to see a floating eyeball trailing ink or muttering to a quill, don’t mind me. I’m just keeping record. It’s what [[Oculus of the Realms\|the Oculus]] does. It’s what I must do.

Until we meet proper,

**Yours in ink and ever-watchful vision,**  
**Lexi**
