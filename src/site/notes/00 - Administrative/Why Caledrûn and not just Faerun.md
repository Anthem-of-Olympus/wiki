While I think Faerûn is pretty cool, the Sword Coast and Eberron don't exactly do what I want to do.

- **Originality of experience**: I want this world to be something you don't see everywhere and anywhere. It's not in a book you can just buy. It's mine, its lore, myths, and monsters are a fresh, new experience.
- **Narrative freedom**: Existing worlds come with a big canon history. Gods, kings, and their kingdoms already exist. Here, I shape the lore without the risk of contradiction or having to compromise.
- **Control of tone**: Large sections of my world will lean into a more _grimdark_ tone, one I’ve found to be a bit of a mismatch with the world of Faerûn. It’s not one big mess of depravity, but tonally, it will be more consistent this way. When things are dark, I want them _properly_ dark.
- **A different shape**: I want a landmass that doesn't already come with established lore, stereotypes, or politics. I want freedom to design the flows of culture, trade, isolation, and colonization, without trying to justify why some desert kingdom has elven ruins in it for the tenth time.
- **Control over the supernatural**: In this world, magic and the unnatural won't be commonplace background noise. The supernatural will carry mystery and weight. Ghost stories will be feared, not explained with a perception check. When something breaks the rules, it should _feel_ like it did.
- **Custom mythology & religion**: I want my own gods. My own saints, cults, schisms, and sacred lies. I want to decide who’s worshipped, who’s burned, and who’s right, for now. The divine shouldn’t be just another category in the Monster Manual; it should shape the world and twist it in strange, sometimes terrifying ways.
