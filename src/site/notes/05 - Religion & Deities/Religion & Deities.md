Across [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]]], religion is not just belief, it is **architecture, law, legacy,** and **war**. Temples grow like forests. Relics burn like suns. The gods walk among man.

Some dwell high in the firmament, some deep beneath the roots of the world. Some walk among mortals wearing human smiles; others remain half-remembered shapes glimpsed in dreams or ruins. And still others drift beyond all boundaries of sanity or structure.

This index arranges the divine into four broadly recognized groupings. While some priests insist on their separations and others deny them altogether, the faithful across [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]] will recognize these names, even if they pronounce them differently.

### Divine Catalogues of the Fold
#### [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Foundationals/The Foundationals\|The Foundationals]]
The primordial powers. These are the old truths; life, death, time, and the silent architect beneath all things. They are worshipped less for comfort, more for stability.

> _“They do not answer prayers. They are_ the reason prayer exists.”_

#### **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Radiant Court/The Radiant Court\|The Radiant Court]]**
The Upper Pantheon, sky-bound gods of sun, storm, judgment, revelry, and fate.  
They are the most publicly worshipped, most richly templed, and most politically entangled.  
Their myths are heroic epics, their feuds the stuff of history.

> _“They rule from the high thrones of cloud and gold. When they argue, cities burn.”_

#### **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Shadow Throne/The Shadow Throne\|The Shadow Throne]]**
The Lower Pantheon, the deities of earth, shadow, blood, and memory. 
They rule beneath, not below. Often feared, often necessary, often misunderstood.  
They do not demand reverence; they command it.

> _“Their realms are thresholds: tombs, gates, secrets, and the soil.”_

#### **[[05 - Religion & Deities/Those Beyond The Veil/Those Beyond the Veil\|Those Beyond the Veil]]**
Entities that cannot be fully known, much less named. They are worshipped by mystics, madfolk, and those who see too far.

> _“Some worship is a scream disguised as song.”_

**Personal Note:**  
I have recorded miracles. I have witnessed faith move mountains and murder.  
I do not judge the gods, but I do keep receipts.
