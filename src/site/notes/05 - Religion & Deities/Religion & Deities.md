### The Shape of Faith
Across [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]], religion is not a pastime but a **pillar**.  
Faith is woven into **architecture, law, legacy,** and **warfare**. Temples rise like forests, relics blaze like suns, and mortals walk daily under the shadow of their gods’ stories.

The gods themselves are not distant abstractions. Some stride openly among mortals, clothed in mortal shapes. Some linger in dream, ruin, or whisper. And others drift at the farthest edges of what mind can hold.

To observe them is to observe civilization itself. Where gods thrive, cities flourish. Where gods feud, kingdoms collapse. I have seen both, and I am still delighted each time mortals rebuild. Their drive is truly impressive.

### Four Great Foldings of the Divine
Scholars and priests debate endlessly over classifications, but across continents one division recurs: four great “catalogues” of the divine. The names differ from land to land, but the shapes remain recognizable.

- **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Foundationals/The Foundationals\|The Foundationals]]** 
  The primordial truths, older than prayer. Worshipped less for comfort, more for stability.
- **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Radiant Court/The Radiant Court\|The Radiant Court]]**
  The sky-bound, richly templed, ever-feuding upper pantheon.
- **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Shadow Throne/The Shadow Throne\|The Shadow Throne]]**
  The often feared, necessary deities of thresholds, oaths, and silence. Their shrines hide in shadow.
- **[[05 - Religion & Deities/Those Beyond The Veil/Those Beyond the Veil\|Those Beyond the Veil]]**
  The unknowable ones that reshape the minds of those who worship, doing irrevocable damage.

### On Continents and Contexts
- In **[[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/Nemetra\|Nemetra]]**, faith and power go hand in hand, to deny belief is to deny the very system that would have you rise to power, or die a nobody.

- In **[[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Volsha/Volsha\|Volsha]]**, worship is widespread, but courtly power does not dictate devotion. It is among the most diverse lands of prayer.

### Final Footnote
Faith in [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]] is not fragile. It is stubborn, radiant, and terribly creative. I cannot worship, but I confess I admire the artistry of those who do.
