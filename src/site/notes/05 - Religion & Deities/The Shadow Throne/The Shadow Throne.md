The **Shadow Throne** is spoken of only in whispers across [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]]. Where the **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Foundationals/The Foundationals\|Foundationals]]** are acknowledged as primordial forces, and the **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Radiant Court/The Radiant Court\|Radiant Court]]** governs hearth, crown, and memory, the Shadow Throne holds sway in silence, in hunger, in the places where mortal prayers rarely dare to tread.

Unlike the Radiant Nine, the Throne has no unified order of [[Keepers\|Keepers]] to bind its lore. Instead, fragments survive in half-burnt scrolls, forbidden tablets, and the mutterings of hermits who claim to have dreamt in their halls. The gods of the Throne are invoked in secrecy, feared as much as they are sought, for their gifts often come at unbearable cost.

### Worship and Influence
- The Shadowed Ones are seen as **dangerous** and **wild**, each embodying aspects of decline, secrecy, or hunger.
- Temples to the Throne are rare, but **hidden shrines** linger in wilderness, ruins, homes and undercities. Some sects claim the Throne is incomplete without its ninth, while others argue that the absence itself is their final truth.
- Worship is often born of **necessity**: a hunter praying to [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Shadow Throne/Kaeron, the Red Fang\|Kaeron]] before the kill, a mourner whispering to [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Shadow Throne/The Stillness, Halthor\|Halthor]] in winter, or a rebel carving [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Shadow Throne/Mireth, the Reclaimer\|Mireth]]’s sign into the stones of a ruined wall.

### Cultural Role
The Shadow Throne represents the **inevitable margins of mortal life**: grief, loss, secrecy, bloodlust, fate, and the weight of forgotten oaths. Unlike the Radiant Court, which frames itself as protection, the Shadowed Ones remind mortals that **not all can be protected**.

To most cultures, they are tolerated but unwelcome. Invoked only when necessity outweighs fear. Yet in every age, the Throne finds followers among the desperate, the grieving, the defiant, and the lost.
