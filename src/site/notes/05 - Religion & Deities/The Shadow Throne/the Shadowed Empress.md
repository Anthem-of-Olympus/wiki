### Summary Designation
**The Shadowed Empress** is counted among the Nine of the **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Shadow Throne/The Shadow Throne\|Shadow Throne]]**. She rules not as protector but as sovereign, her hand heavy upon rulers and dynasties alike. Her blessing can raise a crown, her silence can bury it.

She is most often tied to the imagery of **ravens and veils**, figures of prophecy and concealment. Where the Radiant Court may guide or bless, the Empress embodies cunning. Her omens are not warnings to be averted but notices of what cannot be escaped. In her stories, sorcery and sovereignty are debts owed to fate.

### Core Domains and Conceptual Role
The Shadowed Empress governs the domains of **Fate**, **Omens**, **Sovereignty**, and **Sorcery**. She is rarely invoked by name, as even speaking of her influence is considered a risk. Those who fear the Shadowed Empress whisper not to draw her attention lest you wish to invoke a sealed fate upon yourself.

### Cults and Observances
The Empress appears in myths as a **cold arbiter of destiny**, rarely cruel, but never merciful. Her tales teach lessons of pride brought low, of rulers undone by their own oaths, of magisters whose spells bound them tighter than their foes.
