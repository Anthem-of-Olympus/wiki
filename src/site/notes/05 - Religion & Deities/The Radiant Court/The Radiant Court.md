The **Radiant Court** is the most widely venerated pantheon across [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]]. Where the **Foundationals** are remembered as primordial forces, and the **Shadow Throne** lingers in the margins of myth and dream, the Radiant Court are the gods of **hearths, crowns, battles, and tombs**.

The Court is unified by the work of the [[Keepers\|Keepers]], a silent order of wandering scribes who record the history of the world. Their tomes, shared across temples and sanctuaries, established the canon names and rites of the Radiant Nine. Each land interprets them differently, but the Keeper texts ensure that their worship is recognizable from continent to continent.

### Worship and Influence

- Shrines to individual gods dot every town, but most communities maintain a **Hall of the Court**, where all nine are represented.

### Cultural Role
The Radiant Court represents the **ideals of mortal civilization**: light, law, hearth, protection, beauty, memory, guidance, and mercy. Their myths are retold as **heroic parables**, each story carrying a lesson about justice, loyalty, love, or sacrifice. In taverns and temples alike, children are taught what is right by hearing what the Radiant once did.

Yet the stories also reveal their flaws. The Radiant are often quarrelsome, prideful, or unyielding outside the polished frame of legend. Scholars remark that every tale has two sides: the lesson mortals cling to, and the reminder that gods can be as reckless as those who worship them.

Priests frame the Court as guardians of balance, keeping mortals safe from the chaos of the Veil and the hunger of the Shadow Throne. But ordinary folk know them better as the **heroes and scoundrels of story**.
