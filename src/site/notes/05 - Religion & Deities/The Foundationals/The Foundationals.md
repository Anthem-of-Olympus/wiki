The **Foundationals** are not like other gods. They are not worshipped for their favor or appeased for their wrath. They are not born from myth or made from mortal hope.

They are simply the **first**.

Each one is a singular power that **holds up a truth** the world needs in order to function. Without them, reality would not behave. There would be no rhythm, no shape, no separation, no death, no becoming.

There are **five**, or at least no more than five have ever been confirmed across all records. They do not bicker. They do not change. They do not come when called. But their presence is evident in every breath the world takes.

### The Five Foundationals
- **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Foundationals/Tar Azul, the Raging Flame\|Tar Azul, the Raging Flame]]**  
Disparity, flame, heat, cold; the eternal contrast between burning and stillness, presence and absence
- **[[Kelreth, the Below that Remembers\|Kelreth, the Below that Remembers]]**  
    The sea, depth, pressure, memory; the crushing weight of oceans and what they keep.
- **[[Veyruhn, the Spiral Unbound\|Veyruhn, the Spiral Unbound]]**  
    Chaos, chance, flux; the turning of fortune, the endless unpredictability of being.
- **[[Orzareth, the Fractured Reader\|Orzareth, the Fractured Reader]]**  
    Knowledge, madness, insight; the breaking and remaking of meaning through what is known.
- **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Foundationals/Meyzareth, The Bloom of Want\|Meyzareth, the Bloom of Want]]**  
    Greed, lust, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy, pride, corruption; the fertile soil of all mortal desire.

### Worship and Influence
- The Foundationals are worshipped, though not as widely or openly as the [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Radiant Court/The Radiant Court\|Radiant Court]]. Their temples rise in **isolated cultures, hidden valleys, coastal sanctuaries, and ancestral halls**, often maintained by a single bloodline or secretive sect.
- Their worship is **local, personal, and unstandardized**. One village may sing to [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Foundationals/Tar Azul, the Raging Flame\|Tar Azul]] with bonfires and drums, while a remote monastery carves endless spirals to [[Veyruhn, the Spiral Unbound\|Veyruhn]] into their walls. Families at sea will whisper prayers to [[Kelreth, the Below that Remembers\|Kelreth]] before every voyage.
- Priests of the Foundationals are not always public officials. Many are **hermits, philosophers, and keepers of strange rites**.
- Offerings are diverse and often symbolic: fresh water poured into salt, books deliberately defaced in [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Foundationals/Orzareth the Fractured Reader\|Orzareth]]’s name, or whole harvests abandoned to rot in [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Foundationals/Meyzareth, The Bloom of Want\|Meyzareth]]’s honor.

### Cultural Role
Cultures across [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]] treat them with awe and unease. They are seen not as allies or protectors, but as **constants**: immovable, impartial, and necessary. The Foundationals remind mortals that the world is older, stranger, and far less personal than their prayers might wish.
