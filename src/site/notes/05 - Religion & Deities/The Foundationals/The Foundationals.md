The Foundationals are not like other gods. They are not worshipped for their favor or appeased for their wrath. They are not born from myth or made from mortal hope.

They are simply the **first**.

Each one is a singular power that **holds up a truth** the world needs in order to function. Without them, reality would not behave. There would be no rhythm, no shape, no separation, no death, no becoming.

There are **five**, or at least no more than five have ever been confirmed across all records. They do not bicker. They do not change. They do not come when called. But their presence is evident in every breath the world takes.

### **Simplified Description**
The Foundationals are **primordial forces** that give the world its core structure. Each embodies a single truth so fundamental that nothing can exist without it.

They are not deities in the way most mortals understand the term. They do not rule. They do not judge. They do not choose sides. They simply **are**, and the world is shaped around them.
