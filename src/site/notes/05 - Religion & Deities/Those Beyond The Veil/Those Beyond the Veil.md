The **Beyond** cannot be catalogued in the same way as the Foundationals, the Radiant Court, or even the Shadow Throne. These entities dwell in the [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/Fourth Depth and Below/Fourth Depth and Below\|Fourth Depth and Below]], among the [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/Veilborn\|Veilborn]], and are regarded as godlike only because no mortal has a better word.

No great culture worships them openly. To do so is folly. Those who call to them rarely survive unchanged, madness is the best of outcomes. In the worst, their minds and bodies become unthinkable things, warped until neither prayer nor mercy can reach them.

> “They who worship Those Beyond the Veil are rarely worth saving. As soon as anyone becomes Veil-Touched, they are sure to go mad before death.”  
— _Pastor Einrech, during a peptalk for a military squad before taking down a cult._

[[The Veil\|The Veil]] is the only barrier that keeps the mortal realm apart from whatever else lies outside. When the world itself once collided with that boundary, it left a scar of immeasurable depth, both in the land and in the hearts of those who remember.

It is said that Those Beyond the Veil perceive only the **greater design**, vast and indifferent. If that design does not include mortals, then their erasure is not cruelty but simply detail. Who among us can judge the intent of beings older than time itself?

Their names, if they can be called names, are uncertain. None claim to have seen them, yet whispers persist of three who drift just close enough to be spoken of:
