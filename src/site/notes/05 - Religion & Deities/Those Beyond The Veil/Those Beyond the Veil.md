**Those beyond the Veil** are among the [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/Veilborn\|Veilborn]] existing in the [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/Fourth Depth and Below/Fourth Depth and Below\|Fourth Depth and Below]]. They are regarded as godlike entities, but they are not worshipped by any greater culture. 

> They who worship Those Beyond the Veil are rarely worth saving, as soon as anyone becomes Veil-Touched they are sure to go mad at some point before death
> â€” Pastor Einrech, during a sermon for those who died strayed from the path.

[[The Veil\|The Veil]] is the only thing keeping the mortal realm and whatever else is out there apart, which is seemingly the only way the mortal realm is still left standing. When the world itself collided with the Veil it left a scar of immeasurable depth both in terms of physical proportion and emotional turmoil spewed forth from the events.

It is said that Those Beyond the Veil see only the greater plan, and if that greater plan does not include us.. well then that's unfortunate, but who are we to judge the machinations of beings older than time itself.

While their true names are unknown, and no one has ever seen one according to recorded history, there are three major entities that get spoken of when the topic arises.
