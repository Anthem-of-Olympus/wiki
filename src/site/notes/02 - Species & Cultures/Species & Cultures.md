Welcome to [[02 - Species & Cultures/Species & Cultures\|Species & Cultures]] in this section of the Library, we will delve into the various different humanoid **species** of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]], Their origins, appearance, and place in the world. Some species have a variety of different **cultures** and they will be explained further in this section as well.

Let's start with the dominant species, defined as the most common species (and often called the [[02 - Species & Cultures/dominant species/Common folk\|Common folk]]), but also those with the largest influence, reach, might, and political power.

**Note from Lexi:**  
_Please do not attempt to categorize these entries as “good” or “evil.”  
Morality is a performance, not an inheritance. I have watched saints be born from slaughter, and villains suckle at temples._  

**Addendum: Kobolds**
I have pondered much but I just cannot find a good category to put [[Kobolds\|Kobolds]], so if you're looking for them, here they are.  -Lexi
