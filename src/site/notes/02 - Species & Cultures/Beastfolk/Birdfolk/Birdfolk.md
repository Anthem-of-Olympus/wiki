The **Birdfolk** are a widespread but seldom understood species, found scattered across every continent of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]]. Marked by avian traits, feathers, taloned feet, sharp eyes, and swift reflexes, they are unmistakably [[Humanoids\|Humanoids]], yet never wholly at ease in mortal society. Their sanctuaries are rare, or fortified against suspicion, and their communities often cling to isolation as both shield and tradition.

Though diverse in form and culture (see: [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Nyx\|Nyx]], [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Corvids\|Corvids]], [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Argus\|Argus]], [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Aquids\|Aquids]], [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Pigeots\|Pigeots]]), Birdfolk share one legacy above all: **misunderstanding**. To outsiders they seem secretive, aloof, or prideful, yet in truth they are a proud and weathered people, tempered by histories seldom kind and never short of storms.

### Physiology and Shared Traits
Birdfolk range widely in stature, from **small** individuals barely 4 feet in height to **medium** figures standing as tall as 8 feet. Their frames differ by subspecies, slender, broad, or sleek, but all retain avian advantages: exceptional eyesight, quick reflexes, and a lightness of step that lends itself to hunting, scouting, and rapid travel across difficult terrain.

The gift of wings defines them most clearly. While not all birdfolk soar with equal ease, flight remains central to their identity, shaping their rituals, combat styles, and expressions of freedom.

### Cultural Patterns
Most Birdfolk live scattered among the [[02 - Species & Cultures/dominant species/Common folk\|Common folk]], often alone or in small families. Larger sanctuaries do exist, but they are rare and fiercely guarded, shaped more like strongholds than open villages.

Their customs vary, yet nearly all Birdfolk place deep importance on **ritual recognition**, gestures of greeting, the angle of a bow or incline, eye contact, and the symbolism of flight.

Among travelers, Birdfolk are prized as companions in wild regions. They are known for silence, endurance, and self-sufficiency. Many excel as hunters, foragers, or scouts. Forests, cliffsides, rivers, and ruined domes are all familiar ground to them.

### Subspecies Index
Each Birdfolk subspecies is detailed under its own entry:
- [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Nyx\|Nyx]] - Nocturnal and ritual-bound, keepers of starlit rites.
- [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Corvids\|Corvids]] - Cunning scavengers and lore-keepers, bound by long memory.
- [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Argus\|Argus]] - Towering and ornate, steeped in honor and hierarchy.
- [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Aquids\|Aquids]] - Waterbound navigators with sleek forms and river-etched voices.
- [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Pigeots\|Pigeots]] - Urban messengers and memory-binders, underestimated at one’s peril.
