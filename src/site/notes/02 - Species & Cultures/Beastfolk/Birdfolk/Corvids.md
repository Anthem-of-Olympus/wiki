The **Corvids** are a sharp-eyed, sharper-minded subspecies of [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Birdfolk, Avianis\|Birdfolk, Avianis]], known for their cunning, curiosity, and long-held grudges. Their feathers are often dark, mottled, or oil-slicked in sheen, and many wear trinkets, bones, or memory-charms woven into their clothing or plumage.

They are skilled scavengers, tinkerers, and lore-keepers, often dwelling in edge settlements or within ruins that others avoid. Corvid culture thrives on **exchange**, whether of secrets, favors, or finely measured trust. They speak in clipped phrases, double meanings, and irony, often leaving outsiders unsure whether they’ve just been insulted or inducted.

While not malicious, Corvids are rarely harmless. **Every debt is remembered.**
