The **Corvids** are a sharp-eyed, sharper-minded subspecies of [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Birdfolk\|Birdfolk]], known for their cunning, curiosity, and long-held grudges. Their feathers are often dark, mottled, or oil-slicked in sheen, and many wear trinkets, bones, or memory-charms woven into their clothing or plumage.

They are skilled scavengers, tinkerers, and lore-keepers, often dwelling in edge settlements or within ruins that others avoid. Corvid culture thrives on **exchange**, whether of secrets, favors, or finely measured trust. They speak in clipped phrases, double meanings, and irony, often leaving outsiders unsure whether theyâ€™ve just been insulted or inducted.

While not malicious, Corvids are rarely harmless. **Every debt is remembered.**
