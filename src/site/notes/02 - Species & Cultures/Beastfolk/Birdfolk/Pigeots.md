The **Pigeots** are a city-bound subspecies of [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Birdfolk, Avianis\|Birdfolk, Avianis]], easily overlooked and rarely taken seriously—until it is far too late. Adapted to urban sprawl and dense settlements, they are compact, fast, and uncannily observant. Their plumage is often mottled or ash-colored, their eyes bright and quick.

Pigeots thrive in crowded places, navigating rooftops and alleyways with ease. They are often employed as couriers, or informants. Their culture is one of layered habits and encoded gestures, much of it invisible to outsiders.

Where others see clutter, they see pattern. Where others forget, they remember. You’ll never meet a Pigeot who doesn’t know how you got here, or what you said last time you passed through.
