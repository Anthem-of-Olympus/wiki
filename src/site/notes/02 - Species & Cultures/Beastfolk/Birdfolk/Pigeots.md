The **Pigeots** are a city-bound subspecies of [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Birdfolk\|Birdfolk]], easily overlooked and rarely taken seriously. Adapted to urban sprawl and dense settlements, they are compact, fast, and uncannily observant. Their plumage is often mottled or ash-colored, their eyes bright and quick.

Pigeots thrive in crowded places, navigating rooftops and alleyways with ease. They are often employed as couriers or informants, slipping through cities as if the streets themselves whispered to them. Their culture is one of layered habits and encoded gestures, much of it invisible to outsiders.
