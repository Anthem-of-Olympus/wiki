The **Nyx** are a nocturnal subspecies of [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Birdfolk\|Birdfolk]], known for their wide, light-sensitive eyes and near-silent wingbeats. Rarely seen in daylight and seldom without purpose. 

Most Nyx choose to live in high towers, believing that closeness to the stars brings clarity of thought. Their culture revolves around ritual observation, seasonal stargazing, vigils. Their speech is soft and rhythmic, laced with metaphor and nuance. Some scholars claim it mimics birdsong in ways even the Corvids struggle to interpret. Though not unfriendly, the Nyx are deliberately distant, and always vigilant.
