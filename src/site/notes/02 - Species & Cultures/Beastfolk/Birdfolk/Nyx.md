The **Nyx** are a nocturnal subspecies of [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Birdfolk\|Birdfolk]], known for their wide, light-sensitive eyes and near-silent wingbeats. Rarely seen in daylight and seldom without purpose, they move with a quiet certainty that unsettles outsiders.

Most Nyx dwell in high towers or mountain perches, believing that closeness to the stars brings clarity of thought. Their culture is woven with rituals of observation, seasonal stargazing, long vigils, and solstice rites whispered beneath the firmament. Their speech is soft and rhythmic, rich with metaphor, sometimes mistaken for birdsong by those who cannot follow its nuance.

Though not unfriendly, the Nyx are deliberately distant, their watchfulness mistaken for coldness. In truth, vigilance is their creed, and the stars their oldest confidants.
