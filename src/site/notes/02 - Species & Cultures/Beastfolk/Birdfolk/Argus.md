The **Argus** are a towering and ornate subspecies of [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Birdfolk\|Birdfolk]], marked by elaborate plumage, broad wingspans, and piercing, multicolored eyes. They carry themselves with quiet gravity, every motion considered, every silence deliberate.

They favor high perches, stone cities, and open courtyards for debate and duels alike. Though rarely the first to speak, the Argus are often the last to need to. Their measured dignity can be mistaken for aloofness, but to the Argus, restraint is its own declaration of power.
