The **Argus** are a towering and ornate subspecies of [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Birdfolk, Avianis\|Birdfolk, Avianis]], marked by elaborate plumage, broad wingspans, and piercing, multicolored eyes. They carry themselves with quiet gravity, every motion considered, every silence deliberate.

They favor high perches, stone cities, and open courtyards for debate and duels alike. Though rarely the first to speak, the Argus are often the last to need to.

## Gameplay
- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase one ability score by 2, and increase a different one by 1.
- **Languages**: You can speak, read, and write [[Common\|Common]] and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.
- **Creature type**: You are [[Humanoids\|Humanoid]]
- **Size**: You are [[Medium Creature\|Medium]]
- **[[Speed\|Speed]]**: Your walking speed is 30 feet.
- **[[Flight\|Flight]]**: Thanks to your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing [[01 - Mechanics/Medium Armor\|medium]] or [[Heavy Armor\|Heavy Armor]].
- **Talons.** You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
- **Wind Caller.** Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[01 - Mechanics/Spells/2nd/Gust of Wind\|Gust of Wind]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.
    - Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it when you cast [[01 - Mechanics/Spells/2nd/Gust of Wind\|Gust of Wind]] with this trait (choose when you select this race).
