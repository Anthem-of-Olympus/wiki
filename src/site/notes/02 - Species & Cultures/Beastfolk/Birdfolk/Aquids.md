The **Aquids** are a water-adapted subspecies of [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Birdfolk, Avianis\|Birdfolk, Avianis]], known for their sleek feathers, webbed talons, and natural affinity for currents and coastlines. Their voices roll like river water tinged with layered cadence.

Aquids make their homes along riverbanks, deltas, and tide-hollowed cliffs, often in stilted dwellings or cavern harbors. Their culture reveres flow, timing, and echo. They value adaptability over strength, and memory carried in rhythm more than written word.

Their movements are graceful, almost languid on land, but in water or air they are startlingly fast. In conversation, they often pause. Not because they are unsure, but because they are listening for what you did not say.
