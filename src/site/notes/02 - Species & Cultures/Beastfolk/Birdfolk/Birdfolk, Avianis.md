Birdfolk are a **widespread but seldom understood species**, found scattered across every continent of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]]. They are [[Humanoids\|Humanoids]] marked by avian traits, feathers, taloned feet, avian eyes, and sharp reflexes. Despite their range, Birdfolk communities are few and distant, their sanctuaries hidden or fortified against suspicion.

Though diverse in form and culture (see: [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Nyx\|Nyx]], [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Corvids\|Corvids]], [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Argus\|Argus]], [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Aquids\|Aquids]], [[02 - Species & Cultures/Beastfolk/Birdfolk/Pigeots\|Pigeots]]), Birdfolk share one common legacy: **misunderstanding**. Often seen as secretive or aloof, they are in truth a proud and weathered people, shaped by histories that were rarely kind and never short of storms.

### **Physiology and Senses**
Birdfolk range in size from **small** (roughly 4 feet) to **medium** (up to 8 feet), with body structure dependent on subspecies. Despite their humanoid frames, they retain many avian advantages: exceptional eyesight, precision reflexes, and a lightness of step that lends itself to scouting, hunting, and rapid traversal of terrain.

### **Cultural Patterns**
Most Birdfolk live among the [[02 - Species & Cultures/dominant species/Common folk\|Common folk]], usually alone or in couples. Sanctuaries exist, but they are rare and fiercely protected.

Their social customs vary widely, but almost all Birdfolk place deep importance on **ritual recognition**, ceremonies of greeting, eye contact, body posture, and flight-symbolism. Disrespecting these is not only rude, but in some cases, considered spiritually harmful.

Among travelers, they are often prized as **ideal companions in wild regions**, known for endurance, silence, and self-sufficiency. Many are excellent hunters, foragers, or survivalists. The forest, cliffside, and ruined dome are all familiar terrain.
