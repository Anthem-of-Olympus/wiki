*Filed by Lexicon, Oculus of the Realms  *

Dwarves are much shorter in stature compared to the other Giantkin, but they are just as- if not hardier than their kin. Other races often forget the fact that Dwarves are descendants of the Roaming Giants just as much as Goliath are.

Dwarves pride themselves on craftsmanship and ingenuity, they are the forerunners of industry and exploration. As such they have spread far and wide. Even though their hardy constitution contributes to an easier time surviving in harsh conditions, Dwarves often choose to live in large cities.
