The **Giantkin** are the enduring legacy of the ancient **Roaming Giants** of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]]. Goliath, Firbolg, and Dwarves all claim descent, each reshaping the old inheritance into their own vision of strength, endurance, and belonging.

Where the Giants are careless beings that bring tremendous ruin, the Giantkin seek **identity**. To some this means conquest, to others survival, and to others still, the crafting of a home that will outlast centuries. Together, they embody the truth that power does not vanish..

### **Physiology and Shared Traits**
Giantkin stand apart from other [[Humanoids\|Humanoids]] through their size, endurance, and resilience. Their frames are broader and hardier than most, their lifespans long, and their capacity to endure hardship nearly unmatched.

All Giantkin carry fragments of the **ancestral gift**: immense strength, the weight of presence, and a stubbornness that makes them difficult to break or displace. These traits are codified mechanically as the shared abilities of **Powerful Build** and **Unyielding**, reminders of their towering origin.

### **Cultural Patterns**
Despite common roots, Giantkin diverged sharply in culture:
- **Goliath** remain closest to their forebears, forming martial clans where leadership is proven by might and survival.
- **Firbolg** turn inward to ancestor and spirit, blending giant heritage with deep bonds to forest and memory.
- **Dwarves** look outward to stone and craft, building homes, cities, and legacies that endure where flesh fails.

What unites them is not geography but **persistence**. Whether in peaks, forests, or halls of stone, the Giantkin endure as testaments to survival beyond the fall of giants.

### **Subspecies Index**
Each of the Giantkin is detailed under its own entry:
- [[02 - Species & Cultures/Giantkin/Goliath\|Goliath]] - Clan-bound warriors who test their strength against nature and rival kin.
- [[02 - Species & Cultures/Giantkin/Firbolg\|Firbolg]] - Spiritual stewards of the deep forests, guided by ancestors and shamans.
- [[02 - Species & Cultures/Giantkin/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] - Master builders and explorers, who carve permanence from stone and steel.
