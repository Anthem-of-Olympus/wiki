Firbolg are far descendants from the roaming giants of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]]. Their culture and ideals are strongly rooted in their belief in the power spiritual connection to their ancestors and nature. Where another may prove their power through raw strength or tactical prowess, Firbolg find power in one's connection to those who came before them. As such the wisest Shamans often end up leading Firbolg enclaves.

These enclaves are usually built far away from civilization, preferring roofed and densely packed forests over open plains. While Firbolg are not fast to pass judgement they are often wary of outsiders, relying on the judgement of their elders to guide them in such encounters.
