Of all the giant-kin, Goliath hold on to the belief in strength and power as closely as the giants themselves do. The Goliath gather in warrior clans, bound by honor, rule, and the strength to lead. 

These clans often war against one another for the rights over an area or simply to prove their clan is cut from better cloth, due to this pattern entire Goliath clans can fade into history within the span of only a single generation.

Though they settle the land, they care little for comfort. To them, survival is proof of worth, and so they choose the barren places, deserts, wastelands, and frozen peaks, where only the strong endure. 

In their rites, the Goliath look to [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Shadow Throne/Mireth, the Reclaimer\|Mireth, the Reclaimer]], who embodies the endurance of the strong.
