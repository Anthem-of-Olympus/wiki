**Earth Genasi** carry the weight of stone in their blood. Their skin may be coarse as granite, cracked like shale, or dusted with sand, while their presence is often as steady and immovable as the mountains themselves. Where others falter, Earth Genasi endure, their strength found not in swiftness but in resilience.

To many mortals, they appear slow or stubborn, yet their stillness hides a deep resolve. Earth Genasi often find comfort in solitude, caverns, or wide open plains, where the ground itself feels like kin. They are patient builders and protectors, shaping their lives around permanence rather than change.
