**Water Genasi** embody the fluid grace of rivers and seas, their forms often marked by flowing hair like currents, eyes as deep as tidepools, or skin touched with the shimmer of scales. They move with an ease that mirrors the tide itself, adapting to both land and sea.

To most mortals, Water Genasi are enigmatic: serene one moment, storm-driven the next. Their lives tend to follow the ebb and flow of circumstance, as they drift between roles of wanderer, emissary, and sometimes outcast. Though seldom forming great nations of their own, they thrive in ports and coastal settlements where the oceanâ€™s voice is never far away.
