The **Genasi** are mortals forever altered by cosmic upheaval. Unlike the elves or giantkin, their ancestry does not trace to one people or pact. Instead, they are the inheritors of **events**, shocks of elemental power that bled  into the mortal world from one of the [[Unfiled/Elemental Planes\|Elemental Planes]]. Some of these scars are ancient, others still fresh, but the mark endures: once touched, a bloodline breeds true.

Where elementals are beings of pure force, the Genasi remain undeniably mortal. Yet their forms bear the unmistakable stamp of their origin. A stone-blooded Genasi may carry skin like cracked shale, while one born of water might resemble the fluid grace of merfolk. These changes are not uniform, but they are always present, worn like a second skin that sets them apart.

### Physiology and Shared Traits
Genasi are defined not by height or build, but by the **elemental presence** within them. Their hair, skin, and even breath may carry signs of fire, shadow, tides, stone, light, or storm. Their personalities often lean toward their element, fiery Genasi are bold and volatile, stone-blooded steady and immovable, airborn light and restless.

Though they remain mortal, their elemental stamp makes them subjects of curiosity, fascination, and suspicion. In lands unfamiliar with their kind, prejudice often follows them, for too many see only an elemental’s danger rather than a person’s will.

### Cultural Patterns
The Genasi rarely form nations of their own. Their elemental diversity makes unity elusive, and instead they are scattered across the world, adapting to whichever lands they are born into. Some become emissaries of their heritage, celebrated as living wonders; others live as outcasts, mistrusted for the very spark that defines them.

Despite this, Genasi often carry a **quiet kinship** with one another. When fire meets fire, or water greets water, there is a sense of recognition that transcends bloodlines and borders.
