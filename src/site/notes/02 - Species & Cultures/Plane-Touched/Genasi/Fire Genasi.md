**Fire Genasi** burn with the spark of creation, their bodies often marked by ember-glow eyes, hair like flame or smoke, or skin warm to the touch. Passionate and intense, they are quick to act, their temper and brilliance alike flaring without warning.

Among mortals they are admired and feared in equal measure. Fire Genasi are rarely subtle; they embody both the warmth of the hearth and the devastation of the blaze. Many struggle to temper their drive.
