**Light Genasi** blaze with radiance, their forms often haloed by a faint glow, eyes gleaming like molten gold, or skin that reflects starlight, a being caught between mortal frame and celestial fire.

Their presence is as inspiring as it is dangerous. Many Light Genasi live as though destined to burn brighter and shorter than others, driven by vision, ambition, or a hunger to be remembered. Among mortals they can seem overbearing, even arrogant, yet their intensity springs not from cruelty but from the inexorable pull of brilliance, like moths, they cannot help but fly too close to the sun.
