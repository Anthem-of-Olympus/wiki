**Air Genasi** are the lightest of their kind, born with the restlessness of the skies. Their bodies carry subtle marks of their inheritance, hair that stirs without wind, eyes pale as cloudlight, or skin kissed by the hue of storm. They are seldom still, often driven by wanderlust, curiosity, or the thrill of change.

Among mortals they are often mistaken for fickle or unreliable, but to Air Genasi such judgments miss the truth: the wind never lingers in one place, yet it touches all things. To live as they do is to seek freedom, to refuse the chains of permanence, and to embrace the motion of the world.
