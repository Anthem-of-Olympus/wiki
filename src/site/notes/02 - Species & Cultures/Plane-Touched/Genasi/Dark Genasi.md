**Dark Genasi** embody the silence of the void, their forms often marked by shadow-veined skin, eyes like dying embers, or a chill that lingers in their presence. Where others burn with light, Dark Genasi move with solemn purpose, their very being touched by the stillness of eclipse and the unyielding cold of space.

They are not mournful, but deliberate, speaking little, listening much, and acting with calculated resolve. To others they may seem distant or uncanny, yet their quiet gravity carries its own power.
