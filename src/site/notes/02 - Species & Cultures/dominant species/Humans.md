Of all the mortal peoples, none are so restlessly mutable as the humans. Where elves refine tradition and dwarves anchor themselves in stone, humans scatter like seeds before the wind, rooting in every soil they find. Their lives are short, yet within those decades they burn with invention, ambition, and a willingness to gamble everything on uncertain futures. It is said that no two human kingdoms resemble one another for long, and that is their greatest strength: they adapt, they borrow, they build anew.

In every age of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]], humans have been both architects of empires and sowers of chaos, rising from obscurity to prominence in the space of a single generation. No other people shift the currents of history so quickly or so unpredictably.
