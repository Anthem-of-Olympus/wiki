The **Orcs** are a people of survival and fire, marked by scars of an ancient war that nearly erased them. From those ashes they rebuilt, not only as warriors but as a people bound by faith and community. To most orcs, life is lived in the shadow of devotion to [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Radiant Court/Eryndel, the Bright Blade\|Eryndel, the Bright Blade]], patron of renewal and victory. Yet among the younger generations a new current stirs, some look instead to [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Shadow Throne/Mireth, the Reclaimer\|Mireth, the Reclaimer]], believing endurance, not zeal, will define their future.

Their appearance is as varied as their tempers: pale white, pale blue, muddy or vibrant greens. Their faces are often adorned by jutting tusks. Among men, the size and shape of tusks are thought to reveal latent strength, though wisdom counsels restraint over raw pride. Women often walk the path of spirit and oracle, their insight guiding nations  as surely as the warriorsâ€™ spears.

Orcs are led as much by passion as by reason. Quick to act, quick to anger, and quick to celebrate, their heat of the moment nature has become a formidable political tool when tempered with discipline. In this balance lies their strength: the fire to seize opportunity, and the will to endure after all else has fallen.
