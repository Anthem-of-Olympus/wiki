**Night Elves** carry the weight of an ancient curse. Once devoted followers of [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Shadow Throne/Nytheris, the Masked Stranger\|Nytheris, the Masked Stranger]], they were struck down by the judgment of [[05 - Religion & Deities/The Radiant Court/Thandros, the Crowned Arbiter\|Thandros, the Crowned Arbiter]]. Banished to walk beneath moon and stars, their forms were reshaped, skin dark as polished obsidian, hair stark white or pale yellow, and eyes so pale they seem almost colorless, glimmering faintly in shades of lilac, silver, red, or blue.

Smaller and slighter than most of their kin, Night Elves live on the edges of society. They are a people of solitude, silence, and shadows, most comfortable in nocturnal hours when their curse is a strength rather than a weakness. Many still whisper prayers to Nytheris, believing the Masked Stranger guides them through the dark, though the Arbiter’s punishment lingers with every dawn.
