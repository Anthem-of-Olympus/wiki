**Sea Elves** long ago turned from forests and courts to embrace the deep. They are the most divergent of their kin, dwelling in coral cities and kelp forests hidden beneath the waves. Though seldom seen on the mainland, they thrive in the oceans, their culture shaped by currents, tides, and the endless horizon.

To the landbound, Sea Elves are enigmatic, at once welcoming and ambitious. They mingle freely with [[Triton\|Triton]] and [[02 - Species & Cultures/Plane-Touched/Genasi/Water Genasi\|Water Genasi]], but their history is filled with rivalries over dominion of coastlines, reefs, and trade routes. Power calls to them as it does to their High Elf cousins, though theirs is tempered by the seaâ€™s pull toward both freedom and depth.
