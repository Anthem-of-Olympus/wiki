**Wood Elves** turn inward where their kin reach outward. They dwell in shadowed forests and ancient groves, shaping their lives around the rhythm of nature rather than the pulse of cities or courts. To outsiders they are secretive, even unsettling.

In truth, Wood Elves prize harmony with the wild. They move with uncanny grace through tangled roots and thorned undergrowth, and their settlements are built using the strengths of the natural terrain. Few outsiders are welcomed into these enclaves, but those who are find themselves among a people who see the forest as kin, not as resource.

What sets them apart is their intimacy with natural places. Where High Elves claim the arcane and Sea Elves the tides, the Wood Elves weave their essence into the green and the hidden, walking paths others overlook.
