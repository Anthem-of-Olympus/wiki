The **Elves** are among the most enduring of the mortal peoples of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/Caledrûn\|Caledrûn]], their origin obscured but their presence unmistakable. Wherever they dwell they carry an air of distinction, pride, and memory, as though each step measures not just a life but a lineage.

What defines them is not conquest or endurance, but **refinement**. Through art, magic, and tradition, they seek to shape themselves into ideals, whether of grace, wisdom, or power. To outsiders this often appears as arrogance.

### Physiology and Shared Traits
Elves are recognizable by their tall, slender frames, pointed ears, and sharply defined features. Their movements often appear deliberate, their voices measured, and their lifespans stretch centuries beyond that of most [[Humanoids\|Humanoids]].

All elves share a deeper attunement to the **arcane current** of the world. This affinity makes the practice of magic commonplace among elves, and even those who do not study the arts are subtly shaped by it.

### Cultural Patterns
Though bound by shared essence, the Elves diverged into distinct cultures:
- **High Elves** seek mastery and authority, rising as formidable magi, rulers, or counselors.
- **Wood Elves** withdraw into shadowed groves, secretive and misunderstood, with whispered rumors of occult rites.
- **Night Elves** prefer solitude beneath the moon, travelers who slip between settlements rather than bind themselves to one.
- **Sea Elves** live beneath the waves, mingling freely with [[Triton\|Triton]] and [[02 - Species & Cultures/Plane-Touched/Genasi/Water Genasi\|Water Genasi]], yet their ambitions mirror those of the High Elves.

What unites these branches is a pursuit of **becoming**.

### Subspecies Index
