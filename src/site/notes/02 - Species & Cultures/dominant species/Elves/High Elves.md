**High Elves** regard themselves as inheritors of refinement and mastery, carrying forward traditions of courtly rule, diplomacy, and spellcraft. To walk among them is to walk among those who believe history bends beneath their hand.

Their pursuit of perfection often shades into pride. Where [[02 - Species & Cultures/dominant species/Elves/Wood Elves\|Wood Elves]] embrace secrecy, or [[02 - Species & Cultures/dominant species/Elves/Night Elves\|Night Elves]] solitude, High Elves establish courts and academies whose influence ripples far beyond their borders. To outsiders, they can appear aloof or condescending, yet within their own culture this is simply the weight of centuries of learning and ambition.

It is said that every High Elf is touched by the arcane from birth. Some channel this into artistry, others into politics, and many into wizardry. Whatever the path, their shared heritage ensures that magic is never far from their hand.
