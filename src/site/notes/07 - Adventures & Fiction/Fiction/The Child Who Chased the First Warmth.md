_A fireside tale told in [[The Northern Reaches\|The Northern Reaches]], often recited on the longest night of the year. Filed under [[07 - Adventures & Fiction/Adventures & Fiction\|Adventures & Fiction]]_

Once, before the snow had names and before the stars had places to sleep, the world was still. It was not cold. It was not warm. It simply was.

And in that world lived a child, neither boy nor girl, not tall and not small. The child had no shadow and no name, because nothing in the world had made enough difference to _need_ one.

But then came a breath.  
It was not wind, for there had never been air.  
It was not light, for there had never been dark.  
It was not sound, but it cracked the silence in half like old wood splitting in winter.

That breath became a flame.  
That flame became **[[05 - Religion & Deities/The Foundationals/Tar Azul, the Raging Flame\|Tar Azul, the Raging Flame]]**.

Tar Azul burned without needing to. They burned because they **could**. They burned because burning was the first truth the world had ever known.

And for the first time, the child felt something new: **Warmth.**

It curled around their bare arms and danced in their chest. It made them laugh, a strange broken sound that startled the stillness. They chased it, that flickering orange shimmer, across fields that had never grown and through forests that had never fallen.

But wherever they stepped, something changed.  
Where warmth touched the ground, cold crept behind.  
Where light flashed, shadow came next.  
Where the flame rose, the silence cracked open and names began to fall out.

The child did not understand this, only that **everything** was becoming.

And so the child ran. They wanted the warmth back. They wanted it just for them.

They chased the flame across the belly of the world, begging:  
"Stop, please. Come back. Be mine."

But Tar Azul never turned, never answered. They roared through the sky like a river of breathless stars, and still the child followed. Until at last, high on a blackened cliff, the child reached the end.

The flame turned.

It did not become small. It did not wear a face.  
It became **louder**. **Hotter**.  
It filled the whole cliff, the whole sky, the whole breath between the child’s lungs.

And it spoke. Not in words, but in _cracks_.  
**Snap. Hiss. Break. Burn.**

And from those sounds, the child understood:

> "I am not for you. I am not for anyone.  
> I gave you warmth, and with it, you learned cold.  
> I gave you light, and with it, you saw dark.  
> I gave you difference.  
> And that is more than comfort."

The child fell to their knees. Their hair smoked. Their shadow broke into pieces behind them.

And Tar Azul left.

The next morning, the child woke with a name carved into the back of their teeth. They returned to their village and found it changed. The sky was higher. The snow was colder. The fire was warmer.

And everything had meaning.

### What children are told after:
> If you ever see fire that does not dance, but listens—do not chase it.  
> If you ever feel cold where no breath stirs—stay very still.  
> Tar Azul is not cruel. They are the reason you have **feelings at all.**  
> Thank them when you light your candle.  
> But never ask for them to stay.
