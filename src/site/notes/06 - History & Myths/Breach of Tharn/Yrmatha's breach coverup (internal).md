### A Reconstructed Truth, by the Oculus
In the wake of the catastrophe, the remnants of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Organisations/The Summit Accord/High Council Of Runes/The High Council of Runes\|The High Council of Runes]] moved with remarkable speed. Within mere weeks, they assembled and reinforced a singular narrative. This account was etched into the foundations of a new era, inscribed in stone and sealed by enchantment. It was not merely told, it was enforced.

What follows is the version declared official:
• [[06 - History & Myths/Breach of Tharn/The Breach of Tharn\|The Breach of Tharn]] was the result of a catastrophic planar collision.  
• The origin point was a **forgotten ruin**, disturbed during routine magical research.  
• [[06 - History & Myths/Breach of Tharn/Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)\|Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)]], once a promising mage, had vanished decades prior during a sea-bound expedition. His name was omitted.  
• The Council acted swiftly and with noble sacrifice to close the rift. Their efforts preserved the world.  
• The High Seat of the Council was relocated to a surviving stronghold, and with ceremony, [[06 - History & Myths/The Fractured Era/The Fractured Era\|The Fractured Era]] was declared.

To challenge this account was made a high crime. Punishments included magical silencing, exile, or forced conscription. Doctrine was recited in temples and schools, sealed by runes, and woven into memory by more subtle means.

### Instruments of Memory’s Manipulation
Though I do not interfere, I observe the machinery by which truth is shaped. These are the tools they used to fix the tale in place:

• **Erasure of [[06 - History & Myths/Breach of Tharn/Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)\|Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)]]**  
His writings were incinerated. His name was removed from all registers, rosters, and ancestral archives. A rite known as **The Severance** was performed to dissolve traces of his magical aura from artifacts and unfinished work.
• **Memory Recomposition**  
Survivors who had glimpsed too much were subjected to altered memory or what was politely termed "voluntary reeducation." These procedures were enacted by agents of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Organisations/The Summit Accord/The Pale Mark/The Pale Mark\|The Pale Mark]], often targeting junior mages and those among the soldiery.
• **Displaced Blame**  
The source of the calamity was publicly assigned to unsafe ruins and forgotten structures.
• **Sanctification of the Council**  
The surviving archmagi adopted the mantle of [[06 - History & Myths/The Fractured Era/Yrmatha/The Six Who Remained\|The Six Who Remained]], presenting themselves as chosen witnesses of [[The Veil\|The Veil]]. Monuments were raised before the blood dried, their sacrifice immortalized before questions could take root.
• **Control of the Written Word**  
Magical theory from before the Breach was reclassified as **Archaic and Unstable Practice**. All learning henceforth required council-sanctioned texts. A body known as [[04 - Geography & Politics/Organisations/The Summit Accord/Curatorial Ministry/The Curatorial Ministry\|The Curatorial Ministry]] was founded to identify and eliminate scrolls, treatises, and journals not in alignment with the official version.

### What Still Murmurs Beneath the Surface
Despite the Council's attempts to sever the roots of truth, certain fragments remain. They are scattered, they are dangerous, and they continue to resist the weight of silence.

• **Fragmented Writings**  
Scorched pages, coded margins, and ledger fragments in half-forgotten dialects circulate in secret. Some are housed in black market vaults or locked beneath ruins. Among them are diagrams, schematics of [[The Veil\|The Veil]], and test results recorded in ash and panic.
• **Accounts from the Frayed Edges**  
A small number of personal journals and loose testimonies survived. They come from servants, apprentices, or test subjects who escaped. Their words are scattered and often unreliable, speaking of living geometry, of thought that devours, of things that bled without flesh. These records are rarely believed, even when they are found.
• **The Creatures That Remain**  
Not all that emerged from the Breach perished. Some eluded containment. Others endured. They have been sighted in deep [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/Yrmatha/New Yrmatha\|New Yrmatha]]n mines, in the broken lands beyond the inner sea, or captured by [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/VVatchhalt/VVatchhalt\|VVatchhalt]] patrols. These beings defy classification. Their existence is the wound’s echo.
• **The Whispered Name**  
The name [[06 - History & Myths/Breach of Tharn/Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)\|Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)]] does not appear in official record. It is absent in curriculum, censored in ledgers, and struck from family trees. Yet it resurfaces in dead languages, muttered by cults, and scratched into walls by the desperate. Some do not know why they speak it. Some wish they did not.
• **The Cold Archive of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Organisations/The VVatch/The VVatch\|The VVatch]]**  
Buried within [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/VVatchhalt/VVatchhalt\|VVatchhalt]] lies a collection of truths too dangerous for public light. Guarded by a group known as [[04 - Geography & Politics/Organisations/The VVatch/The Cold Archive/The Cold Archive\|The Cold Archive]], it houses unredacted council correspondence, field notes from the fall of the Spire, trial transcripts, and the final, complete thesis of Daerovil himself.

It also contains a preserved memory, an imprint extracted from a mage who stood present at the moment the Veil gave way. That memory is sealed in layers of spell and supplication, hidden beneath stone and watchful wards.

Those who guard these truths are not selected for loyalty nor for strength, but for the resilience required to look upon the true account and remain whole. Some within [[04 - Geography & Politics/Organisations/The VVatch/The VVatch\|The VVatch]] believe these records are a weapon, waiting for the proper time. Others fear they are a curse, and that to open them would be to begin the Breach anew.
