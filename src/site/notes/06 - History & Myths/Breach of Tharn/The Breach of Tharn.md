_A Chronicle of Cataclysm, c. Year 0 of the Fractured Era_  
What happened that day was no accident. No arcane miscalculation. No divine punishment.  
What happened was **willful**. Born from the avarice of men, _brilliant, cruel men_, whose ambition outweighed both reason and restraint.

### The Age Before the Breach
In the centuries leading up to the Breach, the land now divided between [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/Yrmatha/New Yrmatha\|New Yrmatha]] and [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/VVatchhalt/VVatchhalt\|VVatchhalt]] was one unified power, known then simply as **Yrmatha** (now [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/Yrmatha/Old Yrmatha\|Old Yrmatha]]. A kingdom of dominion and sorcery, unmatched on the continent of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/Nemetra\|Nemetra]]. Their magical reach extended far beyond their borders, enforced by enslaved populations and vassal states who feared the spellwrights of the Spire more than any sword.

Eighty years before the fall, a prodigy emerged from the halls of [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/Yrmatha/Phareh the Summit Spire\|Phareh the Summit Spire]]. His name was [[06 - History & Myths/Breach of Tharn/Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)\|Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)]].

He was no ordinary mage. From birth, Daerovil wielded powers unclassified by any Yrmathan taxonomy. He could move objects with thought. He could read the minds of men. But with these gifts came affliction: **visions**, **voices**, _dreams of elsewhere_. Whispers that bent his will toward a single truth: **there is more beyond the Veil**.

### The Grand Design
At first, his theories were seen as dazzling, if abstract. His thesis _“Harvesting Eternal Flux: Prospects of Veil-Bound Enslavement”_ was received with secret reverence by [[04 - Geography & Politics/Organisations/The Summit Accord/High Council Of Runes/The High Council of Runes\|The High Council of Runes]]. Publicly, it was dismissed as an eccentric work of metaphysical imagination. But within the shrouded halls of the High Arcanum, plans began.

Over the next eight decades, [[06 - History & Myths/Breach of Tharn/Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)\|Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)]] and [[04 - Geography & Politics/Organisations/The Summit Accord/High Council Of Runes/The High Council of Runes\|The High Council of Runes]] worked in secret. The scope of their endeavor was buried beneath layers of obfuscation. On the surface, it appeared as funding for agriculture, nautical expeditions, urban reconstruction. **Whale-hunting, diving colonies, hydro-formic transmutation.** Beneath it all: a single, grotesque goal.

**To tear the Veil. To bind a creature from Beyond. To steal its power for mortal use.**

The experiments grew darker. **People vanished**, including dissidents, whistleblowers, and rival scholars. Those who questioned Daerovil’s work were discredited, then silenced. Some were used. Transmuted. Sacrificed.

The land whispered of horrors in laboratories hidden beneath mirrored lakes and mountain vaults. But no one stopped them. Not the Church, not the nobility, not even the adventurers for hire who sniffed around the truth. Those who knew either vanished or returned broken.

### The Day the Veil Broke
[[06 - History & Myths/Breach of Tharn/Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)\|Daerovil v. Strazzia (internal)]] succeeded. His theory was correct. Passage through the Veil was possible, not clean, not safe, and not survivable in the traditional sense, but possible.

The ritual tore **a gash across reality**, a wound so deep it **split the continent itself**. The capital was annihilated in a blink. Cities along what is now the **Breach of Tharn** crumbled or drowned. The sea rushed in. The stars trembled.

**What came through** was never named. **Only an appendage** made it into our world, but it was enough to **ravage armies** and **send nearby magic into a frenzy** with its screams. It moved like thought and hungered like death.

It took **the unified might of Yrmatha** to sever it:

- [[04 - Geography & Politics/Organisations/The Summit Accord/High Council Of Runes/The High Council of Runes\|The High Council of Runes]], breaking every law of magic to reverse their sin
- The Church, wielding holy relics now long lost
- The Army, in one final charge
- And those few brave souls, arcanists, paladins, and hedge-saints, who **bled the price into the stone**

The Veil was stitched closed, but it was not healed. The thing beyond was cut away, but not destroyed. And **Daerovil** was never found. Whether killed or banished, none can say.

### The World That Followed
The breach remains. A jagged scar, half sea and half grave. **Smaller creatures** slipped through in the rupture, _parasites of unmaking_. Some still haunt [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/Yrmatha/New Yrmatha\|New Yrmatha]]’s shadows, or are captured and dissected by the [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/VVatchhalt/VVatchhalt\|VVatchhalt]], who hold themselves accountable to clean up this mess.

The survivors blamed each other.
- In [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/Yrmatha/New Yrmatha\|New Yrmatha]], the Council tried to erase what they had done. But the whispers never stopped.
- In [[04 - Geography & Politics/Planes/Caledrûn/continents/Nemetra/regions/VVatchhalt/VVatchhalt\|VVatchhalt]], founded by exiles, soldiers, and refugees, the memory became sacred doctrine. They watch. They bind. They will not let it happen again.

And so the world was split.

By sea.  
By war.  
By magic.  
By memory.
