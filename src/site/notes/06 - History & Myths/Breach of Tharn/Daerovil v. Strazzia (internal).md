**Daerovil v. Strazzia** was a remarkable man by all means. Born into great power and genius, with the tools and the will to pursue something greater. His life turned out to be the perfect cautionary tale for those who sought deeper and darker truths behind the arcane and its ways. A cautionary tale that would not be told, for his greatest achievements and all that led to them were erased in [[06 - History & Myths/Breach of Tharn/Yrmatha's breach coverup (internal)\|Yrmatha's breach coverup (internal)]].

## Origins in the Lanes
Daerovil was a [[Unfiled/Half Elves\|half elf]], the son of a [[02 - Species & Cultures/dominant species/Humans\|human]] mother and a [[High Elves\|elven]] father, born on the outskirts of the Lanes. Officially, this district fell under [[06 - History & Myths/Old Yrmatha/The Ten/Roles/The Gatekeeper\|The Gatekeeper]]’s jurisdiction, but functionally it was a slum. Its residents lived by making potions or allowing travelers to briefly speak to [[Devils\|Devils]] for bargains. It was a place of exhaustion and desperation.

From birth, Daerovil bore the rare mark of being [[Born of the Blood\|Born of the Blood]]. Unlike most, he did not exhibit an affinity for the [[Elemental Planes\|Elemental Planes]] or divine channels. His powers were psychic. In a time and place where few understood such gifts, this made him invisible.

That would not last. By the age of thirteen, Daerovil had already begun learning magic on his own, with encouragement from his parents. He was noticed. He was taken in. The Academy gave him a cot on campus, where he studied relentlessly. In time, he discovered that he could hear thoughts if he concentrated. Later, he learned to move objects with his mind. His telekinetic abilities were completely unprecedented, and his performance eclipsed all others. He advanced through the ranks of study faster than anyone expected. Eventually, the Academy began reporting his achievements directly to the [[High Council of Runes\|High Council of Runes]].

At first, they paid him no mind. They did not see how different he was. Not until it was too late.

## The Prodigy’s Climb
As Daerovil advanced, the Academy sought more and more funding to expand the curriculum. Entire classes were quietly built around him. Without his knowing, many of these additions were tailored experiments designed to test the limits of his power and better justify his induction into the Council. Because of his broad academic interest and his refusal to align with any one school of magic, his instructors began to compete with one another. Each wanted to ensure their discipline would earn his favor should he ever rise to political power.

Daerovil knew. He watched them maneuver. He recognized that they wanted him to perform well in their subjects and to show loyalty to their [[01 - Mechanics/Magic/Disciplines/Disciplines\|Disciplines]]. A [[06 - History & Myths/Old Yrmatha/The Ten/Roles/The Grand Magus\|Grand Magus]] sympathetic to one field could tilt the balance of magical law. Though the Grand Magus was not an absolute authority, his influence was immense. Only the [[06 - History & Myths/Old Yrmatha/The Ten/Roles/The Codex Warden\|Codex Warden]] could veto Council-wide decisions.

During his second decade at the Academy, the whispers began. Not the thoughts of other minds, but something else. They came at night. They spoke in distorted tones. He could not understand their meaning, but he understood what they were. This was what truly fascinated him.

## The Scholar in Exile
Years passed. Daerovil graduated with high honors and left the Academy, but he did not retreat into a noble estate. Instead, he returned to the Lanes. He purchased a property and completely remodeled it to serve as a sanctum of magical research. A place of arcane inquiry first, business second, and sleep only when absolutely necessary. He had no need for comfort. He had a need for knowledge.

He often returned to the Academy to access its deeper libraries. The staff never denied him. In the city, he earned coin through consulting. His solutions, both practical and magical, revolutionized sectors of Yrmathan life. One of his most lauded contributions was the creation of [[Conduit\|Conduit]], a scalable alternative to the [[Leylines\|Leylines]]. Where the original [[Leylines\|Leylines]] were massive, ancient, and often immobile, Conduit allowed for the controlled movement of magical energy in concentrated environments.

All the while, he worked in secret. The whispers consumed him. He constructed odd devices, filters for sound and energy, detectors that might catch vibrations from the [[Netherrealm\|Netherrealm]]. Most dismissed these as the ravings of a mind eroding in solitude. In public, Daerovil was a muttering recluse, a prodigy turned eccentric who lived in the slums by choice.

But the people of the Lanes saw something else. Daerovil paid for building repairs. He installed lighting, fixed roads, funded community wards. To them, he was no madman. He was the only mage who ever gave them anything back.

## The Gatekeeper's Visit
Eventually, his work drew the attention of [[06 - History & Myths/Old Yrmatha/The Ten/members/Thamir Lorent\|Thamir Lorent]], the sitting [[06 - History & Myths/Old Yrmatha/The Ten/Roles/The Gatekeeper\|Gatekeeper]]. Lorent began visiting frequently, driven by a curiosity that turned to friendship. He, too, sought knowledge of the Veil. Unlike others, he never viewed Daerovil as a pawn or tool. What began as mutual interest became a shared vision. Together, they refined their methods and tested new limits.

Lorent saw no sin in what they were doing. They were reshaping the future. If the rest of the world did not understand, so be it. Those others were narrow-minded and too afraid to evolve. The pair carried out atrocities, and did so in service of a cause they considered noble.

What they began would fracture the continent. It would leave a scar across the sea and a wound in history. It would awaken something that was never meant to pass into this world.

## End of Life
What happened to Daerovil in the final moment is unknown. No body was found. No final letter was ever uncovered. His name was scrubbed from public record, and all official documents detailing his work were sealed by the Codex Warden.

The capital was lost. The rift was closed. But the price remains.
