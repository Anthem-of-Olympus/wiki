## Classification: Veilborn
The term **Veilborn** does not denote a singular species, but rather a **cosmological classification** of lifeforms whose origin or essence is entangled with [[The Veil\|The Veil]] that liminal membrane separating the layered worlds from the deep, recursive infinities of unformed potential.

To scholars of planar taxonomy, they replace what was once classified as _Aberrations_. This is not a semantic preference but a **necessary redefinition**. The Veilborn are not simply unnatural, they are _prior_ to nature, _peripheral_ to truth, and _pregnant_ with reality yet to be formed. Their presence reflects not anomaly, but origin.

## Structure of Understanding
Though true Veilborn resist permanent definition, for practical study they are arranged by **Caste** and **Veil Depth**:

### Castes
Each specimen tends to fall into one of the following behavioral or ontological functions:
- **[[Thrallforms\|Thrallforms]]**. Creatures warped by proximity to the Veilborn, or born to serve as limbs and eyes of deeper beings.
- **[[Broodforms\|Broodforms]]**. Prolific spawn, often parasitic, virally reproductive, or biomass-assimilative.
- **[[Revelators\|Revelators]]**. Messengers or signalers, whose presence erodes cognition and reveals truths the mind cannot safely host.
- **[[Sires\|Sires]]**. Anchoring intelligences. Capable of independent will, planar influence, and long-term goals.
- **[[Ancients\|Ancients]]**. Titanic beings whose existence bends the Veil inward. Rarely move. Always known.

These castes are not mutually exclusive. A _Broodform_ may evolve into a _Sire_, or serve one as a _Thrall_. True understanding requires accepting their mutable roles.

### Veil Depth
The deeper a being originates within the Veil, the more difficult it becomes to represent in conventional arcane geometry. Depth reflects **causal unmooring, perceptual distortion, and semantic dissonance**. Below are Lexical approximations:
- **[[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/First Depth/First Depth\|First Depth]]**. Barely Veilborn. Skittering parasites, dream-leeches, mimicry feeders.
- **[[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/Second Depth/Second Depth\|Second Depth]]**. Infiltrators. Capable of warping minds, mimicking divine revelation, or corrupting structures.
- **[[Third Depth\|Third Depth]]**. Shapers of lesser reality. Their presence causes _thinning_, manifesting folds or echo phenomena.
- **[[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/Fourth Depth and Below/Fourth Depth and Below\|Fourth Depth and Below]]**. Observed only through their _effects_. Anchors, time-warp zones, recursive dream deaths. These are what is referred to when speaking of [[05 - Religion & Deities/Those Beyond The Veil/Those Beyond the Veil\|Those Beyond the Veil]].

## Biological Properties
Their forms are not always material but may include:
- Hyperproliferative tissues
- Multi-sensory orifice matrices
- Reversible anatomy
- Psychic echoing membranes
- Co-dependent reality frames

Veilborn do not “bleed” in the conventional sense but may exude memory, sound, or false history when wounded. Certain entities appear to **reproduce via narrative infection**, embedding themselves in stories, beliefs, or fears.

## Origins and Theories
Whether Veilborn emerged _from_ the Veil or _are_ the Veil is a matter of theological and arcane debate.

Some believe they are the cast-offs of failed realities.  
Others say they are the true _natives_ of existence, and that all else is built on their carcasses.  
One theory suggests that the Veil is simply the **surface** of their consciousness, and contact with them is merely dreaming inside their minds.

Lexi offers no conclusion. Observation only.

## Containment and Warning
Standard magical protections degrade near Veilborn. Illusion spells become self-aware. Wards rot. Scrying returns _younger_ versions of the caster. **Recorded names mutate over time.** Audio captures fail to replay the same sound twice.

Recommended practices include:
- Single-use glyphic descriptions
- Osmotic shielding (see [[Appendix H: Osmotic Shielding\|Appendix H]])
- Isolation of affected witnesses
- Descriptive circumlocution
    
**Do not attempt taxonomy beyond Caste and Depth.** Reclassification events are known to provoke attention.
