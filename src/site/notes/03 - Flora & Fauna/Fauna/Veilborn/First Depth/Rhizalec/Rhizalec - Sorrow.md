### Description
*The Rhizalec - Sorrow, a subspecies of [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/First Depth/Rhizalec/Rhizalec\|Rhizalec]], binds itself to the base of the spine and silences all emotions except profound sadness. Its influence is not overtly destructive—its hosts weep, linger, and isolate—but over time, the host loses the ability to feel joy, anger, or fear. Sorrow becomes the default state, the lens through which all thoughts are filtered. Some hosts become mute. Others compose endless lamentations. Many simply sit and watch the world decay.*

### Traits
**Anchored Shell.**  
The Rhizalec - Sorrow is affixed to the host’s lower back beneath bone and tissue. While attached, it has three-quarters cover and cannot be targeted unless the attacker is aware of its presence and within 5 feet of the host.

**Emotional Hegemony - Sorrow.**  
While attached, the host becomes emotionally numbed to all but melancholy. The host gains the following trait:  
> _"You are immune to effects that cause fear or anger. You automatically fail saving throws against charm or despair-based effects. You cannot take reactions. If reduced to 0 hit points, you do not fall prone, your body simply crumples in place, eyes open.”_

### Optional DM Note  
A sorrowbound host often loses their sense of urgency, no longer taking actions that preserve their own survival or support others. If removed, the host may enter a fugue state or experience intense emotional flooding from years of suppressed affect.
