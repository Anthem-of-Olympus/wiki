### Description
The **Rhizalec** is a category of Veilborn parasitic entities specializing in **emotive domination**. Unlike the [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/First Depth/Sacculith\|Sacculith]], which amplifies all passions simultaneously, a Rhizalec **enforces singular emotional hegemony**. Victims often appear eerily lucid, focused, and reduced to symbolic archetypes of a single affective state.

Their **external anatomy** is distinctive: a **calcified, barnacle-like shell**, typically embedded at the **base of the spine**, partially hidden beneath clothing or armor. Once anchored, the entity extends **psychic feelers** into the nervous system and limbic brain, where it filters emotional input like a sieve.

Each subspecies expresses one dominant emotion. Known variants include:
- [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/First Depth/Rhizalec/Rhizalec - Wrath\|Rhizalec - Wrath]]
- [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/First Depth/Rhizalec/Rhizalec - Sorrow\|Rhizalec - Sorrow]]
