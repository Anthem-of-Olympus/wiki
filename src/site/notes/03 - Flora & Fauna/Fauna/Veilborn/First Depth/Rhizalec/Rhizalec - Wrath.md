### Description
*The Rhizalec - Wrath, a subspecies of [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/First Depth/Rhizalec/Rhizalec\|Rhizalec]], is a Veilborn broodform that installs itself on the lower spine and severs all affective pathways except those tied to rage, defiance, and violence. Once attached, it filters the host’s perception through a lens of perceived threat and betrayal. Allies become rivals. Memories become accusations. Peace is interpreted as cowardice. Over time, the host becomes a creature of purpose-driven fury, no longer capable of rest, empathy, or mercy.*

### Traits
**Anchored Shell.**  
The Rhizalec - Wrath is affixed to the host’s lower back beneath bone and tissue. While attached, it has three-quarters cover and cannot be targeted unless the attacker is aware of its presence and within 5 feet of the host.

**Emotional Hegemony - Wrath.**  
While attached, the host experiences emotional flattening, suppressing all emotions except aggression. The host gains the following trait:  
> _"You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that has damaged you since your last turn. You have disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws that would prevent you from attacking or would calm you. You cannot take the Help, Dodge, or Disengage actions.”_

### Optional DM Note  
A wrathbound host may begin interpreting strategy, affection, and diplomacy as forms of cowardice or betrayal. Long-term exposure can manifest in martial obsession or battlefield addiction. If the Rhizalec is removed, the host may suffer episodes of emotional collapse or guilt-driven madness.
