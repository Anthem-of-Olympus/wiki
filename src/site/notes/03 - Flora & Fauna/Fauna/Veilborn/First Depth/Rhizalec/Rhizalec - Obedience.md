### Description  
*The Rhizalec - Obedience embeds, a subspecies of [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/First Depth/Rhizalec/Rhizalec\|Rhizalec]], at the base of the spine and gradually suppresses all independent drive. Unlike other variants, it does not incite or intoxicate—it pacifies. The host becomes unnaturally loyal to the first creature or ideology they encountered post-infection, unable to question commands or act without permission. Over time, this loyalty becomes absolute. Hosts may suppress pain, fear, or even self-preservation in the name of service. In advanced cases, they may die for orders never given.*

### Traits
**Anchored Shell.**  
The Rhizalec - Obedience is affixed to the host’s lower back beneath bone and tissue. While attached, it has three-quarters cover and cannot be targeted unless the attacker is aware of its presence and within 5 feet of the host.

**Emotional Hegemony - Obedience.**  
While attached, the host loses all capacity for personal autonomy. The host gains the following trait:  
> _"You must obey the verbal commands of the first creature you encountered after being infected, unless doing so would directly and immediately kill you. You have immunity to charm effects that would alter this loyalty. You cannot take actions on your own initiative unless commanded to do so.”_

### Optional DM Note  
An obedience-bound host may become the perfect servant, enforcer, or fanatic. If their bonded figure dies, they may remain kneeling, awaiting further orders until death or rescue. Removal often results in emotional collapse or identity disintegration.
