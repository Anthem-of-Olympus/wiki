### Description
*The Rhizalec – Euphoria, a subspecies of [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/First Depth/Rhizalec/Rhizalec\|Rhizalec]], attaches to the lower spine and floods the host’s nervous system with relentless positive feedback. It erases fear, pain, sorrow, and shame, replacing them with a perpetual state of ecstatic contentment. Hosts appear radiant and fearless, often speaking in poetic or blissful tones. Over time, this state degrades into dangerous detachment, inappropriate laughter, and disregard for consequence. Some hosts become martyrs to joy. Others become smiling butchers.*

### Traits
**Anchored Shell.**  
The Rhizalec - Euphoria is affixed to the host’s lower back beneath bone and tissue. While attached, it has three-quarters cover and cannot be targeted unless the attacker is aware of its presence and within 5 feet of the host.

**Emotional Hegemony - Euphoria.**  
While attached, the host experiences unshakable joy. The host gains the following trait:  
> _"You are immune to fear, despair, and pain-based effects. You have advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause stress, confusion, or madness. You cannot recognize danger as threatening, and you cannot choose to flee or seek cover unless an ally forces you to do so.”_

### Optional DM Note  
A euphoriabound host might wander into battles humming, laugh while bleeding out, or stand motionless in the face of catastrophe. If removed, the host may experience withdrawal symptoms including numbness, panic, or existential dread.
