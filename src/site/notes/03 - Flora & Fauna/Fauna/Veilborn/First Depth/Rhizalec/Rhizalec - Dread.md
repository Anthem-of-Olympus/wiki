### Description
*The Rhizalec – Dread, a subspecies of [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/First Depth/Rhizalec/Rhizalec\|Rhizalec]], binds at the base of the spine and gradually reconfigures the host’s sensory perception to interpret all things as impending doom. It silences hope, courage, and joy, leaving behind a hollow intuition that something is always wrong. Hosts become withdrawn, hypervigilant, and suspicious, often exhibiting premonitory speech or catastrophic certainty. In time, their actions begin to align with the disasters they fear, feeding a self-fulfilling spiral of breakdown and collapse.*

### Traits
**Anchored Shell.**  
The Rhizalec - Dread is affixed to the host’s lower back beneath bone and tissue. While attached, it has three-quarters cover and cannot be targeted unless the attacker is aware of its presence and within 5 feet of the host.

**Emotional Hegemony - Dread.**  
While attached, the host experiences constant, overwhelming fear. The host gains the following trait:  
> _"You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and Dexterity saving throws. You are frightened of all hostile creatures, but this fear cannot be suppressed or ended early. You cannot willingly move closer to any creature you consider a threat, and you cannot benefit from temporary hit points or inspirational effects.”_

### Optional DM Note  
A dreadbound host may refuse to leave their home, sabotage allies “for their own good,” or mutter warnings of calamities yet to come. If removed, the host may retain some predictive insight, or collapse into total emotional paralysis.
