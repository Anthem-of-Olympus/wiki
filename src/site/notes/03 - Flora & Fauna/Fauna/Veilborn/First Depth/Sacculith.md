### Description
The **Sacculith** is a Veilborn broodform known to infiltrate hosts of elevated emotional or intellectual capacity. It is not physically imposing, most initial forms resemble translucent molluscoid cysts.

Upon infection, the Sacculith **amplifies core emotional drives**. Fear becomes terror, desire becomes obsession, anger becomes blood-hunger. The host's cognition is not erased or suppressed, but *clarified* to an unbearable degree.

Some refer to it as a **“lucidity parasite.”** Victims are known to achieve sudden genius before collapsing into violent mania, self-destruction, or prophetic ranting.

### Traits
**Parasitic Hide.**  
While attached to a creature, the Sacculith is indistinguishable from tissue, scar, or cyst. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to remain hidden and cannot be targeted by attacks or spells unless a creature succeeds on a **DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine or Perception) check** to detect it as a separate entity.

**Psychic Echo (Host Dependency).**  
The Sacculith does not take actions. While attached, the host has the following trait:  
> _"Emotions are intensified. The host has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against being frightened or charmed. Each time the host takes damage, it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be overwhelmed by a dominant emotion (e.g., rage, despair, lust, terror) for 1 minute (DM’s discretion).”_

**Mindless.**  
The Sacculith cannot act independently. It has no ability to attack, cast spells, or communicate. It does not roll initiative and takes no actions on its own.

### Optional DM Note
If the host fails three Psychic Echo saves in a day, the Sacculith becomes semi-integrated. It may begin to alter the host’s memories or personality. Consider long-term effects for narrative depth (e.g., gaining temporary spell slots but risking madness).
