This entity does not attack in the traditional sense. Instead, it erases existence from shared reality. Victims are not killed but forgotten. Their possessions remain, their marks upon this world remain. But no one knows who made them.

The Nameless One has never been sighted on our side of the [[Veil\|Veil]].

## Appearance
Descriptions of its physical form vary, and none agree. Some fitting descriptions are 'a shadow of eyes across the sky' or 'a breathing void shaped like an animal that never was, whale, spider, stage, or whale sized moth.' 

The most reliable transmission comes from a [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/Watchers/Watchers\|watcher's]] internal record:

> "It is absence given profile. It is the sound memory makes when it dies."

## Abilities
### Oblivion Exhalation
- Creatures within 120 ft. must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma save or be afflicted with *progressive erasure*
- While afflicted they begin disappearing from memories, spell books, written records and dreams. Including those of their party members.
- After X failed saves across encounters, the creature vanishes entirely.
- Resurrection magic does not recall them. They never existed.

### Namebreak Aura
- All creatures within 60 ft. of The Nameless One lose proper nouns: names, places, spells, even gods.
- Communication becomes unmoored: "You know, her... the one with... the thing..."
- Spellcaster must roll a DC 20 Arcana check to recall their own spell names

### Myth eater (legendary action)
- Targets a creature known by legend, prophecy, or religious dogma.
- That creature's mythic status is consumed: they lose class features, divine boons or ancestry based traits for 1d6 days.
- If used on a PC with a famous backstory, that story ceases to have happened.

### Not There (Trait)
- Cannot be targeted by divination, memory-reading, or sending-based communication.
- Any spell or scrying effect aimed at it returns the result: _“Target does not exist.”_
