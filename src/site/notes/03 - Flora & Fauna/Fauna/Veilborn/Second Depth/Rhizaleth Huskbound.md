### Description
*The **Rhizaleth Huskbound** is a Veilborn of the Second Depth, found only in Wrath-bound configurations. It fuses completely with the host's musculature and skeleton, forming an armored, symbiotic carapace. The host's voice becomes gravelled and echoing, their skin hardens to layered scale, and their eyes lose all trace of identity. Unlike the [[03 - Flora & Fauna/Fauna/Veilborn/First Depth/Rhizalec/Rhizalec\|Rhizalec]], the Huskbound **acts in concert with its host**, pushing it toward vengeance, conflict, and personal retribution. They are rarely subtle. They are never merciful.*

### Traits
**Symbiotic Wrathplate.**  
The Rhizaleth Huskbound is bound to a living host creature, fusing with its nervous system and exoskeletal layer. While bound:
- The host gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage
- The host gains +2 to melee weapon attack rolls while bloodied (below half HP)
- The host cannot be frightened, charmed, or knocked unconscious unless killed

**Last Breath Strike.**  
When the host is reduced to 0 hit points, it immediately makes a melee weapon attack with advantage before collapsing. This attack is considered magical and deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage.

**Veilbound Fury.**  
If the host has taken damage on its previous turn, it cannot willingly retreat, disengage, or take the Dodge action.

**Linked Fate.**  
If the host dies, the Huskbound dies as well. If the Huskbound is destroyed independently (via targeted spell or Veilborn-disruption effect), the host immediately suffers 4d6 psychic damage and is stunned until the end of their next turn.

### Optional DM Note  
Huskbound hosts are ideal lieutenants, berserker champions, or tragic revenants. Their wrath is personal and goal oriented, the Huskbound is merely amplyfing that which is already in place.
