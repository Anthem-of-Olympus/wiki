### Description
**Watchers** are a class of extraplanar beings whose purpose appears to be the **non-interventionist recording of reality**. Though their exact origin is uncertain, they are universally recognized as non-hostile, often appearing in long-forgotten places, moments of cosmic significance, or near individuals poised to alter the course of history.

### Form and Behavior  
The earliest encountered Watchers (designated *Oculus Minor*) often appear as **floating eyes, crystals, or mirrored lenses**, rarely larger than a melon, and always silent. As they accumulate time and information, Watchers evolve into increasingly complex and symbolic forms, **rings of orbiting glass**, **ink-stained astrolabes**, **constellations of echoing eye-spheres**, and, eventually, **monuments of memory itself**.

All Watchers share the following behavioral constants:
- **They do not initiate violence**
- **They are unaffected by time or hunger**
- **They cannot be bribed, coerced, or persuaded**
- **They can, and do, evolve**

### Evolution and Memory Accretion  
A Watcher **does not grow by feeding, but by observing**. The longer it remains undisturbed in a location of magical or narrative significance, the more it accumulates context, both sensory and metaphysical.

Over time, it transitions between states (designated below), gaining new abilities such as:
- Reconstructing past events
- Interpreting future potentialities
- Storing knowledge as spatial phenomena
- Protecting information from entropy

Known evolutionary tiers include:
- **[[Oculus Minor\|Oculus Minor]]** - The newborn eye  
- **[[Oculus Mediator\|Oculus Mediator]]** - The lens that interprets  
- **[[Oculus Archivum\|Oculus Archivum]]** - The memory made manifest  
- **[[Oculus Prime\|Oculus Prime]]** - The Deep Record, near-divine observer
- [[Oculus of the Realms\|Oculus of the Realms]] - Only one of these has been registered, [[Lexicon\|Lexicon]], assigned by a god himself. Whether an evolutionarily step or just a title is unclear.
