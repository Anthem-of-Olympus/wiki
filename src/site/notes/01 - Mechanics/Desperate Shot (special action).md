Use this action to fire a firearm **before it has been fully reloaded**.
- Make the attack with **[[01 - Mechanics/Core Attributes & Skills/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]]**.
- The weaponâ€™s **[[01 - Mechanics/Weapon Attributes/Misfire\|Misfire]] threshold increases by +2**.
- After firing, the weapon becomes **[[01 - Mechanics/Fouled\|Fouled]]**.

This action represents a reckless attempt to force the mechanism before it's ready. It is not recommended unless the risk is worth the desperation.
