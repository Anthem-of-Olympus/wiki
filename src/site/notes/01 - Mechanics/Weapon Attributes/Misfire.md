Certain weapons, particularly early firearms, include a **Misfire** property. When you roll a d20 attack with such a weapon, if the natural roll is **equal to or lower than the Misfire threshold**, the weapon **misfires** and cannot be fired again until it is cleared or repaired.

> **Example**: A weapon with **Misfire 2+** misfires on a natural roll of **2 or lower**.

### What happens when you misfire?
When a weapon misfires, roll 1d6 on the **Misfire Table** below (or substitute a custom table per weapon or powder type). Misfires can range from harmless clunks to catastrophic backfires.
