You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. 

Drawing the ammunition from a [[01 - Mechanics/Items/Weapons/Ammunition/Quiver\|Quiver]], [[01 - Mechanics/Items/Weapons/Ammunition/Case\|Case]], or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). 

At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. 

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an [[01 - Mechanics/Weapon Attributes/Improvised Weapons\|Improvised Weapon]]. A [[Sling\|Sling]] must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
