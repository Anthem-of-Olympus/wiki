Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of [[01 - Mechanics/Weapon Attributes/Ammunition (weapon property)\|Ammunition (weapon property)]] from it when you use an [[Action\|Action]], [[Bonus Action\|Bonus Action]], or [[Reaction\|Reaction]] to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
