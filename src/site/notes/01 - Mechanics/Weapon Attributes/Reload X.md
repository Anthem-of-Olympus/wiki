A firearm with the **Reload X** property can hold up to **X shots** at once. You must **fully reload** a weapon before it can be fired again.
- Reloading the weapon entirely takes an [[Action\|Action]].
- Reloading a **single shot** takes a [[Bonus Action\|Bonus Action]] per shot.
- You must have **one free hand** and access to the proper [[Ammunition\|Ammunition]] to reload.

> **Example**: A firearm with _Reload 2_ can fire twice. Once empty, the wielder can:  
> — Spend 1 [[Action\|Action]] to reload both shots,  
> — Or spend 2 [[Bonus Actions\|Bonus Actions]] across two turns to reload one shot at a time.

Attempting to fire a firearm **before it is fully reloaded** results in a **[[01 - Mechanics/Weapon Attributes/Misfire\|Misfire]]**.  
However, there is a rule exception for dire circumstances, see: [[01 - Mechanics/Desperate Shot (special action)\|Desperate Shot (special action)]].
