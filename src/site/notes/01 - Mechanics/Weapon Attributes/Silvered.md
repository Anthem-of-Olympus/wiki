Some monsters that have [[Immunity\|Immunity]] or [[Resistance\|Resistance]] to [[Nonmagical\|Nonmagical]] weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of [[01 - Mechanics/Weapon Attributes/Ammunition (weapon property)\|Ammunition (weapon property)]] for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.
