Honestly downtime in my current campaigns has always been kinda lackluster...  especially when travelling, it always devolves to a point of "Its time to rest, is there anything you guys wanna do after you set up camp? alright then give me some survival rolls for camp and food". 

## Source
Then I ran into this video which inspired me to change it up :

## Goal
Make downtime matter, make the world feel more real lived in and 'survivally'


## Takeaways and potential mechanics
Adding a resource with accompanying things to do with that resource.

### Downtime Action Resource
[[Downtime Actions\|Downtime Actions]] which he suggests awarding at a rate of 1 per [[Short Rest\|Short Rest]] and 2 per [[Long Rest\|Long Rest]] 

What he also mentions is gaining more proficiencies.. which honestly was already a mechanic I love from the [[Call Of Chtulu\|Call Of Chtulu]] system

Suggested actions:

1. Tend Wounds
-> This allows the characters to spend their hit dice, like they would normally in a short rest. This indirectly buffs short rests for any player that does not want to heal themselves during the rest because it allows them to spend their Downtime Action on something else entirely.
2. Practice
-> By having the things required to practice a certain skill any character may spend a downtime action to learn a skill. Choosing to practice counts as Half a Day of progress towards learning a skill, There will be a dm table with how long it takes to improve at certain skills and what it takes to learn them. if another player already proficient in that skill also chooses to use their downtime action to help you learn it will add another half day of progress. 
**Very Strong if tuned poorly, make sure the numbers are tuned to the length of the campaign**
3. Forage
   The basic premise of this skill should be simple, you search for ingredients. the idea is that not all members of the party should be required to do this but a majority should. 
   
   Failure: Only retrieve 1 food ingredient
   Success: Retrieve 2 food ingredients
   Critical Success: Retrieve 3 food ingredients
   
   However something I might also want to include here is the 'marking' of resources to collect later, for instance a certain kind of tree wouldn't be something easily foraged but would take hours to cut down and process, but I want that to be connected somehow, maybe I will split foraging into looking for food and looking for crafting materials, but there's only so much they can do each rest
4. Cook
   Turn any number of food ingredients into rations 1:1 
   A single ration will feed a single person.
   
   This is also where I should connect special cooking which rather than pumping out rations for the sake of survival will create 'special' foods if certain checks are made successfully and a proper combination of ingredients was used.
5. 

## What does it need to tie in to
I will have [[01 - Mechanics/01 - Life Skills/01 - Foraging/Foraging\|Foraging]], [[Harvesting\|Harvesting]] and [[Crafstmanship\|Crafstmanship]] ([[Alchemy\|Alchemy]], [[Enchanting\|Enchanting]], [[Crafting\|Crafting]], and [[Cooking\|Cooking]]) included in this system but besides that it also needs to connect properly to [[Surviving\|Surviving]] which is heavily tied into the [[01 - Mechanics/Core Attributes & Skills/Survival Skill\|Survival Skill]] and the [[01 - Mechanics/Core Attributes & Skills/Nature Skill\|Nature Skill]].
