Allowing players to gain fame or infamy will allow the world to feel more alive, the party to feel more recognized and most importantly reward heroic/villainous parties accordingly.

Progress reputation by doing deeds, What is a deed? 2 of the following must be true:

1. The normal people of the realm will hear about this from sources other than the party (e.g. Other bards, talk among the guards or perhaps witnesses).
2. It is an accomplishment that hasn't been completed by other adventurers (in a long time).
3. This task radically changes the lived experience of normal people in the wider world.


A perk is picked after 5 Deeds towards one end have been completed.
